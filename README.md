Fiddle Around with Typescript
==============================

This is a basic repository that will permit you to play around with
Typescript. Just put code into the "play.ts" file and use the menu:

    Debug -> Start Debugging

or hit "F5" to execute. Choose the "Node.js" configuration.

Check the Debug Console to see output. 

You can set breakpoints and inspect variables in the debugger.
